\section{Introduction}

ICT, in Sub-Saharan Africa, in several cases has enabled convergence of productive sectors, serving as platform for more holistic development.
In fact, there are many examples of ICT developments in Africa that cut across traditional sectors: notable examples are the introduction of micro-health insurance and health-savings accounts through mobile devices; index-based crop insurance; crowd-sourcing to monitor and manage the delivery of public services, etc.
These innovative applications – for several reasons more disruptive in social terms than many counterparts in the EU - recognize and leverage commonalities between sectors, blur traditional lines, and open up a new field of opportunities.

The opportunity for ICT intervention in Africa is huge especially of IoT and big data: those technologies are promising a big wave of innovation for our daily life.
It is widely accepted that the Era of IoT can potentially connect billions of sensors, devices, equipment, systems, etc.
In turn, the challenge is about driving business outcomes, consumer benefits, and the creation of new value.
The new mantras for the IoT Era are becoming collection, convergence and exploitation of data.
The information collection involves data from sensors, devices, gateways, edge equipment and networks on to their respective siloed IoT platforms in order to increase process efficiency through automation while reducing downtime and improving people productivity.

When developed countries still discuss about massive deployment of IoT, countries like Sub-Saharan Africa are still far from being ready to enjoy the full benefit of Iot. This is because of many challenges : lack of infrastructure, high cost platforms complexity in deployment, etc. At the same time, it is urgent to promote IoT worldwide : WAZIUP will contribute by reducing part of technology gap between EU and Africa. Thus, the goal of WAZIUP is to deploy and validate real-life piloting with several Sub Saharan African cases. 

WAZIUP is a 3 years H2020 international cooperation action started on February 1st, 2016.
The project is driven by a consortium of 5 EU partners and of 7 partners from 4 sub-Saharan African countries.
Furthermore, it has support from multiple African stakeholders with the aim of defining new innovation space to advance the African Rural Economy.
It will do so by involving end-users communities in the loop, namely rural African communities of selected pilots, and by involving relevant public bodies in the project development.
WAZIUP will accelerate innovation in Africa by coupling with current EU innovation in the sector of IoT and Big Data: this EU technology will be specialized to generate African cost effective technologies with an eye to preparing the playground to the future technological waves by solving concrete current needs.
WAZIUP will deliver a communication and big data application platform and generate locally the know how by training by use case and examples.
The use of standards will help to create an interoperable platform, fully open source, oriented to radically new paradigms for innovative application/services delivery.

WAZIUP targets the rural community in Sub-Saharan Africa because about 64\% of the population is living outside cities.
The region will be predominantly rural for at least another generation.
The pace of urbanization here is slower compared to other continents, and the rural population is expected to grow until 2045.
The majority of rural residents manage on less than few Euros per day.
Rural development is particularly imperative in sub-Saharan Africa, where half of the rural people are depend on the agriculture/micro and small farm business, other half faces rare formal employment and pervasive unemployment.
For rural development, technologies have to support several key application sectors like living quality, health, agriculture, climate changes, etc.
WAZIUP project consider how to best design and deploy the IoT-Big Data technology considering cost and energy challenges in the first place.

The biggest challenge of WAZIUP is to reduce costs and power consumption while increasing the robustness of the hardware. Hardware has to be robust enough so as to require lower maintenance and handle environmentale and deployment treats as well. 
WAZIUP will present an innovative design of the IoT platform dedicated to the rural ecosystem. To achieve that, low-cost, generic building blocks will be deployed for maximum adaptation to end-applications in the context of the rural economy in developing countries. 

Another challenge of WAZIUP is to be able to manage the network deployment and to facilitate IoT communication. 
Lower cost solutions has to be used : privilege price and single hop dedicated communication networks, energy autonomous, with low maintenance costs and long lasting operations.
Dynamic management of long range connectivity has to be taken into account (e.g., cope with network \& service fluctuations), such as devices identification, abstraction/virtualization of devices, communication and network resources optimization.

Finally, WAZIUP aim to exploit the potential of big-data applications in the specific rural context. Data will be collected from the IoT sensors themselves, but WAZIUP will also collect open data from other sources to build predictive models and enrich the platform. 


From a technical standpoint, WAZIUP will pay attention to all related privacy and security aspects with specifics addressing the involved communities (farmers, developers).
Models will receive requirements from users’ needs to have a personalized and friendliness usage and will ensure compliance with all most common usability standards (e.g., Web Accessibility Initiative - WAI or ISO/TR 16982:2002). 
An open interoperable platform will be designed through open standard and protocols from the Geospatial Consortium (OGC), W3C, IEEE from the European SDOs (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, etc.) for all its key technology.
Continued Openness will be ensured through the release of open specification and open software components and/or algorithms.
Low-cost and low-energy consumption will be possible through the design of innovation hardware (sensors/actuators), and of IoT communication \& network infrastructure.


The rest of this book chapter is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:platform} presents the architecture of the WAZIUP platform. 
Section~\ref{sec:implem} shows the implementation chosen. 
Section~\ref{sec:deploy} details the deployement of WAZIUP, contrained by its environment.
Section~\ref{sec:usecases} presents four use cases that will be used to validate the WAZIUP concepts.
Section~\ref{sec:relworks} presents a survey of the literature on the topic, together with a survey of the Big Data Open Source tools.
Finally we conclude the chapter in Section~\ref{sec:conclu}.
