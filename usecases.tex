The project will build a strong community able to address innovation in the African rural ecosystem through EU ICT technology.
Actors from various disciplines, including those having industrial backgrounds, those from application areas and target end-users will push towards the creation of an African-European innovation ecosystems based on the open sources for the IoT-Big data platform.
Starting from the rural domain, the project technology will allow the
African young application developer to produce new added value supporting multiple applications domains in the long run.
The induced ecosystem renews the business paradigm: new benefits are engendered from providing and sharing devices, services, and data across stakeholders and applications.
