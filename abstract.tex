Furthermore, the current research  and marker trends shows the convergence between IoT and Big Data.
On the other hand, Africa as a continent has seen very little of this activity.
In this book chapter we present WAZIUP, a project aiming at building an open innovation platform able to accelerate innovation in rural Africa.
The WAZIUP platform will allow to develop IoT applications coupled with Big Data capacities.
The platform is taylored to the specific requirements and constraints of African users.
We will give an overview of the WAZIUP IoT and Big Data platform, detail its technical aspects and finally introduce four use case deployements.
