\section{IoT \& Big Data Platform}

Challenges of WAZIUP will be tackled using an open IoT-big data platform with affordable sensors connected through an IoT-Cloud open platform.
This platform will also make use of mobile phones and real-time processing to empower users and deliver the needed services.
The project will not develop any new IoT/Big Data software platform, but, rather exploit the existing solutions and adapt them for the purpose. Hereafter a compact list of core technical functionalities encompassed by the platform:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \emph{Cloud-based real-time data collection combined with analytics and automation software:} thus, the platform will offer cost-effective solutions for aggregating different machines and sensor types to engender efficiency, smart automation and optimization in the rural context.
   \item \emph{Intelligent analytics of sensor and device data:} studied in order to optimize for performance of the rural workplace, detect potential outages, and finally reduce overall maintenance costs.
   \item \emph{Integration to 3rd parties' platform:} enables customers' benefit of scaling fast and easy.
   \item \emph{PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) provider:} WAZIUP will provide to business clientele with independently maintained platform upon which their web application, services and mobile applications can be built.
\end{itemize}
